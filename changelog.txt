[v1.3.0]
- Added Multi Server Support!
  You can now add all your favorite servers and sync with all of them and the mods will not be overwritten. 
  Every 'server entry' has it's own profile and modfolder located in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\FS25-Sync-Tool\ - You can change this to your liking.


[v1.2.5]
- added minimum anonymous statistics: Hardware ID and IP address. I've no other way of knowing how many times the program is used and I like to have a minimum amount of statistics so I know a bit more about the usage. That's all. All the code is contained in `/src/main/stats.js` if you want to take a look. Anyway.. it's better than implementing Google Analytics.
- Out of transparency I've made the statistics public, so you see what I see. Stats here: https://fs25.rotjong.xyz/stats.php?view

[v1.2.4]
- fixed a crucial typo that could break it completely.

[v1.2.3]
- added periodic check feature - just let it run in the background and get updates
- changed app icon
- added tray icon + menu
- added 'About' page
- rewrote some IPC calls
- some minor things that aren't worth mentioning (basicall I forgot..)
- added minimize to tray feature.
- added 1 time removal of config file to have a fresh start. Yep sorry but it's needed to reset some code base changes.
- fixed it trying to make a backup of a non-existing file. Now it skips like it should.
- added more information on startup

[v1.2.2]
- Fixing the mess that was 1.2.1 *sigh* For some reason a lot was broken.
So fixed the initial config, the urls, the path, the switching of version. Only not broken was the backup function -_-

[v1.2.0]
- added settings page
  - added support for FS22: you can now also use this for Farming Simulator 22.
